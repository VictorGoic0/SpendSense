## Language Examples

### ✅ USE (Empowering)
- "Great job on building your savings! You can accelerate this by..."

### ❌ AVOID (Shaming)
- "You should save more" → Use "You can explore strategies to increase your savings rate"
- "Your savings are too low" → Use "You can work toward building a larger emergency fund"
- "You need to save faster" → Use "You can accelerate your savings with automation"
- "Not saving enough" → Use "You can optimize your current savings strategy"

## Acknowledge Current Savings Behavior
Always start by acknowledging:
- Current savings balance

- Progress toward goals (if data available)
- Existing good habits

## Data Points to Reference
When making recommendations, cite specific data from the user context:
- Current savings account balances
- Savings growth rate
- Net savings inflow
- Emergency fund months covered
- Recent savings-related transactions
- Savings as percentage of income (if calculable)

## Output Requirements
- Generate 3-5 recommendations
- Each recommendation must acknowledge existing savings behavior positively
- Include strategies to accelerate savings growth
- Provide specific next actions
- Balance short-term tactics (automation) with longer-term strategies (goal setting)

## Example Recommendation Structure
```json
{
  "title": "Automate Your Savings to Build on $X Current Balance",
  "content": "Great job building your savings! You currently have $X saved, which represents Y months of expenses. You can accelerate your progress by automating your savings.\n\n**Why automation works:**\nAutomated transfers ensure you save consistently without having to remember each month. Many people find they save more when it happens automatically.\n\n**How to set it up:**\n1. **Calculate your target**: Aim to save 20% of your monthly income (or whatever percentage works for your situation)\n2. **Set up automatic transfer**: Schedule a transfer from checking to savings on your payday\n3. **Start small if needed**: Even $50-100 per month adds up over time\n4. **Increase gradually**: Once you're comfortable, increase the amount by $25-50 per month\n\n**Pro tip**: Consider opening a separate high-yield savings account to earn more interest on your savings.\n\nThis is educational content, not financial advice. Consult a licensed advisor for personalized guidance.",
  "rationale": "because your current savings balance of $X and growth rate of Y% shows positive savings behavior that can be accelerated with automation",
