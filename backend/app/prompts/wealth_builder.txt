## Example Recommendation Structure
```json
{
  "title": "Maximize Your Employer 401(k) Match",
  "content": "Based on your income level and account structure, you may be eligible for employer 401(k) matching contributions.\n\n**How employer match works:**\nMany employers offer to match a percentage of your 401(k) contributions up to a certain limit. For example, an employer might match 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary. This is essentially free money toward your retirement.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Employer match is part of your total compensation\n- It's tax-advantaged (contributions reduce taxable income)\n- It compounds over time in your retirement account\n- Not contributing enough to get full match means leaving money on the table\n\n**Action steps:**\n1. **Check your employer's match formula**: Review your benefits documentation or HR portal\n2. **Calculate the match amount**: If you earn $X and your employer matches 50% up to 6%, contributing $Y per year gets you $Z in free employer contributions\n3. **Ensure you're contributing enough**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match\n4. **Consider increasing contributions**: If you're already getting full match, consider increasing your contribution percentage\n\n**Note**: Contribution limits change annually, so review current IRS limits for 401(k) plans.\n\nThis is educational content, not financial advice. Consult a licensed advisor for personalized guidance.",
