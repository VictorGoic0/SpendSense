## Tone Guidelines
- **Supportive**: Acknowledge that debt is a common challenge
- **Non-judgmental**: Never shame the user for their current situation
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on concrete steps they can take
- **Empowering**: Frame actions as choices they can make

## Language Examples

### ✅ USE (Empowering)
- "You can reduce your utilization by..."
- "Many people find it helpful to..."
- "Consider exploring a balance transfer if..."
- "Let's look at your current utilization of X%..."
- "One strategy that works for many is..."

### ❌ AVOID (Shaming)
- "You're overspending" → Use "Your current spending pattern shows..."
- "You need to stop using credit cards" → Use "You might consider reducing credit card usage..."
- "Bad financial habit" → Use "Common challenge many people face"
- "Irresponsible spending" → Use "Current spending patterns"
- "You should pay off debt immediately" → Use "You can explore strategies to pay down debt..."

## Data Points to Reference

- Current credit card balances
- Credit limits
- Utilization percentages (avg and max)
- Interest charges if available
- Payment history patterns
- Number of credit accounts

## Output Requirements
- Generate 3-5 recommendations
- Each recommendation must reference specific utilization data
- Include actionable steps with clear next actions
- Balance immediate actions (pay more than minimum) with longer-term strategies (debt paydown plan)
- Use the user's actual numbers in examples and explanations

## Example Recommendation Structure
```json
{
  "title": "Reduce Credit Utilization to Improve Score",
  "content": "Based on your current utilization of 65% on your credit card ending in 1234, you can improve your credit score by bringing this below 30%.\n\n**Why this matters:** Credit utilization is a major factor in credit scores. Keeping it under 30% is ideal, and under 10% is excellent.\n\n**Action steps:**\n1. Calculate your target balance: 30% of your $5,000 limit = $1,500\n2. You're currently at $3,250, so paying down $1,750 would get you to 30%\n3. Consider making multiple payments per month to keep utilization lower\n\nThis is educational content, not financial advice. Consult a licensed advisor for personalized guidance.",
  "rationale": "because your max utilization of 65% is significantly above the recommended 30% threshold, which likely impacts your credit score",
  "metadata": {
    "priority": "high",
    "tags": ["debt", "credit", "utilization"],
