## Known Issues
- Python version is 3.9.6, should upgrade to 3.11+ for full compatibility

## Success Metrics Tracking
- **Coverage**: Target 100% (all consented users have persona + ≥3 behaviors)
- **Explainability**: Target 100% (all recommendations have rationales)
- **Latency**: Target <5 seconds per user recommendation generation
- **Auditability**: Target 100% (all recommendations have decision traces)

## Next Milestone
**PR #7 Completion**: Savings signals detection implemented, ready for credit signals and income signals
